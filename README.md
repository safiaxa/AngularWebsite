# AngularWebsite

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.10. The following displays the build/run instructions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Summary of the Assignment

■ Approach
- In developing this Angular portfolio website, my approach prioritized user-friendliness and skill enhancement. I leveraged Angular's component-based structure for modularity and routing for seamless navigation. Data binding and structural directives were used for dynamic content presentation. Animations added interactivity, and Bootstrap ensured responsiveness. Code organization followed Angular best practices. The result is an intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient web presence.

■ What features you’ve implemented? The main Angular features that I've implemented includes: 
- Components (home, about me, navbar, experiences)
- Routing (navbar)
- Data binding (for interpolation) and Structural Derivatives (Ngfor/NgIf)
- Lifecycle Hooks: (NgOnIt)
- Services (title of pages) 
- Animations (TypeScript + BrowserAnimationsModule)
- Component LIbraries: Bootstrap
- Forms (FormsModule - for filtering cards in the projects component)

■ Given more time, what else would you have liked to complete and how
long would it have taken you? Or, what would be the next steps to
improve this implementation?

Quick Styling features I would add:
- Add a carousel for my project cards (I think it would be relatively easy to implement using the Bootstrap library and would need to use CSS to style)
- Add a footer on the Home page that would give redirect to links such as Github, Linkedin, social-media 
- Add a menu bar instead of a nav bar
- Interactive background instead of static background
- Accessibility - make sure that website looks good on different screens
These styling features could be implemented in a short time period within a day. Unfortunately, this week is midterm week or I would have added them :).

More Complex Concepts:
- Authentication and Authorization: (using Firebase Authentication/JSON Web Tokens)
- Observables + HTTP Client to include chatbot feature and live chat
- Widgets using RESTful APIs - to display weather or waterloo news, or cool facts to make the website more interactive (can add charts using  D3.js or Chart.js)
- Use modules an incorporate lazy loading
These features would take me longer (a couple days) as I would have to read the Angular documentation and would take longer to debug.
